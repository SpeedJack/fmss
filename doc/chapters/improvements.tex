\chapter{Improvements to the Controller}

To improve the resilience for attacks the control unit is updated using a
different algorithm to compute values for actuators. In particular, instead of
a simple average between the two left sensors and the two right sensors, a
weighted average is used. The weights are the distances between the robot's
center and the position off the other sensor in the same side. So far values
uses as weights mid distance and vice versa.
