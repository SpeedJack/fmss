\chapter{Attacks}

In this chapter we're describing the attacks that we want to simulate using
INTO-CPS\@. The attacks that we have developed are in the two variants seen
during the course:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Control: Attacks that are implemented changing the code of the
		Controller FMU\@.
	\item FMU\@: Attacks implemented using additional FMUs placed between
		two legitimate FMUs.
\end{itemize}

We have developed 6 attacks, 3 for each variant. The attacks on the control FMU
are the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Actuator Control Attack;
	\item Complementary Attack;
	\item Switch Sensors Attack.
\end{itemize}

The attacks with additional FMUs are the following:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Actuator Scale Attack;
	\item Max Speed Attack;
	\item Sensor Output Attack.
\end{itemize}
