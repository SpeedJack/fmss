\subsection{Max Speed Attack}

This attack is carried out adding two extra FMUs between the \code{controller}
and the \code{plant} FMUs, one for each output of the \code{controller}.

This attack can be performed in two different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interval Mode: In this mode the attack is performed once, for an
		interval of time defined by the attacker, starting from an
		instant chosen from the attacker.
	\item Cyclic Mode: The attack is performed periodically.
\end{enumerate}

The attacker can choose some parameters:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \code{Real attack\_time}: The time at which the attack starts.
	\item \code{Real attack\_duration}: The duration of the attack.
	\item \code{Real attack\_value}: The speed at which the actuator should
		drive the motors of the LFR during the attack.
	\item \code{Bool cyclic}: If \code{true} the attack is performed
		periodically.
\end{itemize}

The objective of the attack is to set the values for the actuators, contained in
the \code{plant} component, so that the robot will go at the speed chosen from
the attacker.

The FMU algorithm is shown in \lstref{lst:maxspeedattack}.
