\subsection{Sensor Switch Attack}

The attack result differs from the two different controllers. In the classic
version after the attack it follows the path in clockwise direction after the
attack, in the improved version it follows the path in anticlockwise direction,
this can be explained looking at the angle of incidence of the robot when after
the attack return on the path.
