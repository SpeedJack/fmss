\subsection{Complementary Attack}

The complementary attack into the improved controller doesn't make any
difference, the result is the same of \figref{fig:complatkresult}. This is
because both sensor algorithms see black on the left, so as an effect of the
complementary attack the robot turns right in both cases.
